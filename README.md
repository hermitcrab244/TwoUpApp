## Description

You have been asked to develop a Two-up game. This project could be coded using Java and Visual Studio Code. You are free to discuss your choice of language with your assessor when you gather the program requirements.
The game will be based on the toss of two coins.
The company you work for is keen to support its workers who work on Anzac Day.
To that end they have decided to offer them a two-up game to play on Anzac Day.
It is a game of chance, and no betting will be permitted.
The game will be played at lunchtime on the day and the person who has won the most games at the end of the break will be given a meal voucher.
You are to research Two-up and its origins and the rules of the game.
Create a user interface for the game that is customisable for each player.
